# How Real Madrid manufactures space through movement and positioning to orchestrate comebacks

As part of Soccermatics Project 3


This project focuses on how Real Madrid creates and exploits space. 

It consists of 3 parts. We look at:


1. Spatial occupation patterns (wide vs central) - establishes Real Madrid's baseline spatial strategy. We explore how Real Madrid's spatial occupation patterns (wide vs central) change between when they are behind in a game vs when they're leading. Do they prefer wide or central areas to control the tempo and opposition?

2. Decoy/distraction running - shows how individual players manipulate that space without the ball. We investigate which Real Madrid players create the most dangerous off-ball runs during comeback scenarios, and how this distracts defenses to open space for others. We ask the question "which players create the most threat without touching the ball?" 

3. Comeback mechanisms - reveals how these spatial principles intensify or adapt when trailing. We study if Real Madrid shifts their spatial strategy (more central penetration vs wide stretching) when trailing, and which "distracting runners" enable this shift.


We're essentially showing how Real Madrid's space creation system operates under pressure - which is when it matters most.
