# How Real Madrid manufactures space through movement and positioning to orchestrate comebacks

As part of Soccermatics-Project-3

This project consists of 3 parts. We look at:


1. Spatial occupation patterns (wide vs central) - establishes their baseline spatial strategy

2. Decoy/distraction running - shows how individuals manipulate that space without the ball

3. Comeback mechanisms - reveals how these spatial principles intensify or adapt when trailing

We're essentially showing how Real Madrid's space creation system operates under pressure - which is when it matters most.
