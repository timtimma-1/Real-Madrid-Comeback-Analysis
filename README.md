# How Real Madrid manufactures space through movement and positioning to orchestrate comebacks

As part of Soccermatics-Project-3

This combines:

Spatial occupation patterns (wide vs central) - establishes their baseline spatial strategy
Decoy/distraction running - shows how individuals manipulate that space without the ball
Comeback mechanisms - reveals how these spatial principles intensify or adapt when trailing

We're essentially showing how Real Madrid's space creation system operates under pressure - which is when it matters most.
